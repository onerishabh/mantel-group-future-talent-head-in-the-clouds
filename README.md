## Features/API's

* When the user click's `Add Note`, the user's IP address and browser agent details are streamed in a AWS Dynamodb table. 

### `/send_message`
* Allows users to contact the admin with custom messages. This is done by sending user details via AWS SNS. 
* Further, the user is given the option to signup for the mailing list. The mailing list is stored on AWS Dynamodb Table.
